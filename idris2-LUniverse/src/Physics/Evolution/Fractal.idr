||| Substrate-Independent Scale Engine Interface
|||
||| Instead of hardcoding physics separately for quarks, cells, and planets, 
||| any physical system (substrate) can implement this interface. If a substrate
||| can maintain linear logic gates and obey the 137 Leibniz Lag capacity, 
||| it is Turing-Complete over the Primorial Manifold!

  ||| The structural Scale Order index (e.g. 0 for Quantum, 4 for Biological)
  scaleOrder : Nat
  
  ||| The maximum accumulated Leibniz Lag this substrate can handle before 
  ||| experiencing an Adaptive Cycle collapse (Decoherence).
  capacityLimit : Integer
  
  ||| Substrate-specific representation of the Dark Energy / Latent Fraction states (128).

  ||| Substrate-specific representation of the Dark Matter / Fractional Residue
  ||| left behind when a state is shattered by the b=13 Resonance Gate.
  ResidueState : Type
  
  ||| The fundamental logic gate of reality: partitions an unformed linear resource 
  ||| into the 128 / 27 polynomial split.
  partitionLogic : (1 _ : a) -> (LatentState, VisibleState)
  
  ||| Evaluates the b=13 Decoherence Resonance.
  ||| When the substrate exceeds its `capacityLimit`, the b=13 polynomial shatters 
  ||| the visible state, forcing wave-function collapse / cellular apoptosis / societal fracture,
  ||| leaving behind a foundational fractional residue.

||| The Recursive Fractal Nesting
|||
||| A scale order is not an isolated domain. By definition, an Observer at 
||| Scale N+1 is simply an aggregated grid of the substrate at Scale N.
||| Idris 2 dependent types enforce this recursively!

  BaseGrid : (1 substrate : a) -> FractalScale 0 a
  
  ||| The Recursive Step: Scale N+1 is formed by aggregating a list of Scale N
  ||| objects. A cell is a grid of molecules; a society is a grid of humans.
