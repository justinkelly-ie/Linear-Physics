||| Epoch 2: The Genesis of Baryons
|||
||| Standard astrophysics assumes Baryogenesis (the sudden manifestation of matter)
||| was a thermal accident driven by a slight CP violation in the early universe, 
||| with no mathematical explanation for why exactly that much matter formed.
|||
||| In LUniverse, Epoch 2 is mathematically inevitable. As the primordial Spread 
||| Polynomials unfold recursively, they reach a threshold where their mathematical 
||| combinations partition exactly into the 210-state Primorial Manifold:
|||
||| 1. 128 states (2^7) resolve into irreducible fractional denominators. They
|||    cannot be instantiated on the discrete integer grid, becoming the invisible
|||    Dark Energy expansion pressure.
||| 2. 55 states remain as the topological background vacuum (Dark Matter).
||| 3. Exactly 27 states (3^3) resolve cleanly into integers. A 3x3x3 grid is 
|||    the geometric definition of a Baryonic Triad (3 quarks).
|||
||| Thus, Baryogenesis is just the mathematical sorting of polynomial states 
||| into 27 resolvable integers and 128 unresolvable fractions!

||| A formal proof that Epoch 2 creates exactly 27 integer states.
||| This is the root cause of Baryon Asymmetry.
