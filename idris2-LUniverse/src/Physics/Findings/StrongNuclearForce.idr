||| Strong Nuclear Force (Color Confinement)
|||
||| In standard particle physics, the "Strong Force" binds quarks together inside 
||| hadrons, mediated by the exchange of gluons.
|||
||| In the LUniverse model, forces are purely structural topologies. 
||| The Strong Force is not a "pulling" force—it is the structural integrity of 
||| the dynamic partition grid. Ripping a quark out of the vacuum creates an irreducible 
||| S_5 fractional state (a Dirac Hole / topological defect).
|||
||| Because an isolated fraction cannot resolve into the integer grid, its 
||| "Leibniz Lag" grows infinitely the further it is pulled. To prevent a Grid 
||| Fracture, the system is mathematically forced to spawn an anti-quark pair 
||| to plug the hole (Vacuum Polarization), or pull the quark back in.

||| Proves that the vacuum must annihilate (zip up) any topological defect
