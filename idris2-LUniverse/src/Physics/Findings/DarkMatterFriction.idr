||| The Tully-Fisher Relation & Dark Matter Gravitational Drag
|||
||| In standard astrophysics, the rotational velocity of galaxies implies the
||| presence of significantly more mass than is visibly observable. This invisible
||| mass is termed "Dark Matter" (comprising ~27% of the universe).
|||
||| In the LUniverse model, Dark Matter corresponds to the
||| exactly 55 states of the Maxwell Background Vacuum (which is 26.2% of the
||| 210-state pool).
|||
||| Gravitational Drag: As the 27 visible states (galaxies/stars) move, they
||| must propagate across the discrete 55-state Maxel grid. This grid is not
||| empty; it is a rigid lattice of mathematical tension. Moving through it
||| induces geometric "friction" or drag. This drag mathematically limits the
||| angular momentum of the visible cluster and explains why spiral galaxies
||| do not tear themselves apart.
|||
||| Gravity on a galactic scale is not a pulling force; it is the physical
||| drag of attempting to displace the rigid 55-state vacuum grid!
