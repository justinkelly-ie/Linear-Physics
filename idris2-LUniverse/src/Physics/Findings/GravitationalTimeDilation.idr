||| Gravitational Time Dilation
||| 
||| In standard relativity, time runs slower in stronger gravitational fields.
||| In the LUniverse model, "Time" is merely the computational progression
||| of state resolution. 
|||
||| The S_7 polynomial (Time Dilation Gate) introduces extreme fractional 
||| complexity. As the integer coordinate state passes through S_7, it accumulates 
||| "Leibniz Lag". The more Lag a localized cluster has, the more CPU cycles it 
||| takes the universal background to resolve its position, making its internal 
||| clock tick slower relative to the empty space grid!

interface ExperiencesTimeDilation a where
  ||| Computes the amount of computational lag (Time Dilation) a state suffers.
  ||| Returns the "Z-depth" or computational depth factor.
  calculateLeibnizLag : a -> Double

||| The total lag is derived from the topological complexity (length) of the 
||| un-annihilated DenseAMSet array.

||| High Time Dilation pushes the observed wavelength of light beyond the visible 
||| spectrum, hiding it from observers.
