||| The Periodic Table and The Feynmanium Limit
|||
||| In standard physics, Richard Feynman famously predicted that element 137 
||| (Untriseptium, or Feynmanium) represents an absolute physical limit. Beyond 
||| $Z = 137$, the $1s$ orbital electron would be required to travel faster than 
||| the speed of light to remain in its orbit. Standard physics views this as a 
||| relativistic breakdown.
|||
||| In the LUniverse model, we rely on our discrete calculus.
||| An atom is an aggregate of Baryons. As you build heavier atoms, you are locally 
||| integrating the fractional residues of the Quarks (combining triads). This integration
||| accumulates an absolute topological debt against the dynamic grid limit.
||| 
||| We measure this using the `leibnizIntegralLag`. When the accumulated lag
||| exceeds the absolute maximum address space of the grid (defined by the partition limit), 
||| the grid physically runs out of memory to render the atom's internal binding.
||| The atom suffers a catastrophic "Decoherence" (radioactive decay or spontaneous 
||| fission). 
||| 
||| Element 137 is not a speed limit—it is a combinatorial storage limit!

||| The absolute limit of stable chemistry on the grid.
||| Uses Fin 138 to perfectly bound atomic numbers from 0 (Vacuum) to 137.
