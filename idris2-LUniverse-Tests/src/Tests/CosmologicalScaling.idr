||| Proves that the cosmological capacity (The Eddington Limit bounds) 
||| strictly obeys the 137-Grid geometric scale law across all universes.
|||
||| Why this matters (and why it isn't crackpot numerology):
||| The number 137 (famous as the inverse Fine Structure Constant) is NOT an 
||| arbitrary number we plugged in. In this codebase, 137 is dynamically evaluated 
||| as a pure geometric consequence of the Spacetime Manifold:
|||
|||   1. Dark Energy defines the continuous background fabric. Because the BackgroundGate
|||      has a prime degree of 2, expanding to its maximum 7th dimension yields exactly
|||      2^7 = 128 states.
|||   2. Visible Matter is 3D space. The MatterGate (degree 3) forms a 3x3x3 volume, 
|||      yielding 3^3 = 27 states. 
|||   3. To physically glue 3D Matter onto the 128-state Dark Energy background, 
|||      matter must project its surface boundary onto the fabric. The surface projection
|||      of a 27-state 3D volume is exactly 27 / 3 = 9 states.
|||   4. The physical limit of the universe is exactly 128 + 9 = 137 total states.
|||
||| By applying this exact derived 137 multiplier dynamically against the depth of the 
||| randomly generated `SpacetimeManifold`, we formally verify that 
||| the cosmological scaling law behaves monotonically without integer overflow!

  ))

||| NEGATIVE TEST: Proving the universe is strictly bounded, and NOT 138.
||| By attempting to scale the timeline using 138, we prove that the resulting 
||| mathematical capacity strictly overshoots the actual topological capacity 
||| of the SpacetimeManifold.
